My name is Philipp Rudloff.

## Work

### Sendcloud B.V.

2019 – Present<br>
Eindhoven, Netherlands

- **Senior front-end developer**<br>
  Full-time<br>
  January 2021 – Present

  At Sendcloud, I worked on several teams on pretty much all frontend-related aspects of the platform including feature development, internationalization, API design, technical writing, general maintenance, the hiring process, and mentoring of new front-end developers.

  I heavily contributed to planning and finalizing the multi-year effort of migrating the platform’s main frontend to a Vue.js-powered application.

  For well over a year, I’m a part of the development department’s checkout team now. There, I was a core contributor to establishing the foundation for a new system of features that deeply integrates with various e-commerce platforms. Besides the general involvement in the front-end development process, I’m responsible for writing the public technical documentation, designing APIs, and maintaining related legacy systems.

  Technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Vue.js)

- **Front-end developer**<br>
  Full-time<br>
  July 2019 – December 2020 (1 year, 6 months)

### Bauhaus-Universität Weimar

2017 – 2019 (1 year, 11 months)<br>
Weimar, Germany

- **Front-end developer**<br>
  Contract<br>
  2018 – 2019

  I was tasked with building upon the prototype of Disraptor, a tool for decoupling the development of an arbitrary web application from the need to implement auxiliary functions like authentication, user management, and social networking based on the Discourse forum software.

  Technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Ember.js), Ruby (Rails)

- **Front-end developer**<br>
  Contract<br>
  2017 – 2018

  I built Slidehub, a web-based browser for easily accessing a large number of PDF documents (e.g. for presentations, lectures, talks, etc.).

  Technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## Education

2014 – 2019 (5 years)<br>
Weimar, Germany

- **Computer Science & Media (B.Sc.)**<br>
  Bauhaus-Universität Weimar<br>
  2014 – 2019

## Skills

I work with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and have experience in most areas of the front-end development landscape. That includes:

- Planning and implementing robust interfaces for users (simple and complex UI components) and developers (APIs and tools)
- Writing technical and non-technical documentation for these interfaces and systems
- Managing and maintaining localization systems

If you’re looking for the list of buzzwords to check off of your list: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Vue.js, TypeScript, git, package publishing, [OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about), [Phrase](https://phrase.com), [Eleventy](https://11ty.io), and those I intentionally or unintentionally forgot to remember.
