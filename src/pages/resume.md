My name is Philipp Rudloff.

I’m a front-end developer building websites and web applications with accessible user interfaces. I’m capable of designing and implementing a robust software architecture which works well for the system’s developers and, most importantly, its users.

## Work

- **Front-end developer** at Sendcloud B.V.

  Eindhoven, July 2019 – Present

  At Sendcloud, I worked in several teams on pretty much all frontend-related aspects of the platform including feature development, internationalization, API design, general maintenance tasks, and the hiring process and mentoring of new front-end developers.

  Besides heavily contributing to finalizing the multi-year effort of migrating the platform’s main frontend to a Vue.js-powered application, I’m also involved in the decision-making processes of one of the department’s biggest projects, yet.

  Technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Vue.js)

- **Front-end developer** at Bauhaus-Universität Weimar

  Weimar, 2018 – 2019 (1 year, 3 months)

  Here, I was tasked with building upon the prototype of Disraptor, a tool for decoupling the development of an arbitrary web application from the need to implement auxiliary functions like authentication, user management and social networking based on the Discourse forum software.

  Technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Ember.js), Ruby (Rails)

- **Front-end developer** at Bauhaus-Universität Weimar

  Weimar, 2017 – 2018 (8 months)

  For my first software development commission, I built Slidehub, a web-based browser for easily accessing a large number of PDF documents (e.g. for presentations, lectures, talks, etc.).
