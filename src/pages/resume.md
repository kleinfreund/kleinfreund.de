  Aug 2022 – Apr 2024

At Kong, I was responsible for the general maintenance and development of the UI application that is part of the Kuma and Kong Mesh products (on-premise software). As part of this, I managed the migration from Vue version 2 to 3. I’ve also set up several pieces of continuous integration-based automation that range from application testing to preparing the UI application for release. I was also part of the team developing Mesh Manager for Kong’s Konnect product (SaaS software). In short, I was involved in all front-end development activities surrounding Kong’s service mesh offering.

At Sendcloud, I worked in several teams on all frontend-related aspects of the platform including feature development, internationalization, API design, technical writing, general maintenance, hiring, and onboarding/mentoring of frontend developers.

I heavily contributed to planning and finalizing the multi-year effort of migrating the platform’s main frontend to a Vue-powered application.

Then, I was part of the checkout team where I was a core contributor to establishing the foundation for a new system of features that deeply integrates with various e-commerce platforms. I’ve developing the third party script responsible for rendering a custom shipping method UI in a merchant’s shop. I was also responsible for writing the public technical documentation, designing APIs, and maintaining related legacy systems.

## Skills

I have experience in most areas of the frontend development landscape and am comfortable working with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript regardless of framework, utility library, or underlying authoring methodology. That includes:

- Planning and implementing robust interfaces for users (simple and complex UI components) and developers (APIs and tools)
- Writing technical and non-technical documentation for these interfaces and systems
- Managing and maintaining localization systems
