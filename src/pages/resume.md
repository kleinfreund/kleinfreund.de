Hey there, my name is Philipp Rudloff and I’m a front-end developer.

At Sendcloud, I worked in several teams on all frontend-related aspects of the platform including feature development, internationalization, API design, technical writing, general maintenance, hiring, and onboarding/mentoring of front-end developers.

I heavily contributed to planning and finalizing the multi-year effort of migrating the platform’s main frontend to a Vue.js-powered application.

Now, I’m part of the development department’s checkout team. There, I was a core contributor to establishing the foundation for a new system of features that deeply integrates with various e-commerce platforms. I’m developing the third party script responsible for rendering a custom shipping method UI in a merchant’s shop. I’m also responsible for writing the public technical documentation, designing APIs, and maintaining related legacy systems.

## Skills

I have experience in most areas of the front-end development landscape and am comfortable working with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript regardless of framework, utility library, or underlying authoring methodology. That includes:

- Planning and implementing robust interfaces for users (simple and complex UI components) and developers (APIs and tools)
- Writing technical and non-technical documentation for these interfaces and systems
- Managing and maintaining localization systems
