Hey, I’m Philipp.

I’m a web developer from Weimar, Germany. Currently, I’m studying Computer Science and Media at Bauhaus-Universität Weimar.

In summer, I will start a job as a frontend developer at SendCloud and move to Eindhoven in the Netherlands.


I primarily write HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with a focus on accessibility. Find more details in my [CV](/cv).
