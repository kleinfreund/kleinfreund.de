Hi, I’m Philipp

I’m a German front-end developer living in the Netherlands.

At least for now. I’ll go anywhere with a comfortable amount of sun light and where I can make myself understood.

I build websites and web applications with a focus on robust and usable developer and user interfaces. I’ve put my [résumé](/resume) on here in case you seek to relocate me.

I [write about things](/articles). I do so very rarely.

I keep [a record of my favourite music](/list-of-lists) (2014 – present).

Feel free to write me love/hate mail to <a href="mailto:{{ metadata.author.mail }}" rel="me">{{ metadata.author.mail }}</a>.
