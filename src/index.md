Hi, I’m Philipp.

I’m a front-end developer. I lived in Germany; now I’m in the Netherlands.

I read sci-fi and love space stuff. I love having brunch and eat entirely too many pancakes.

I’ll go anywhere with a comfortable amount of sun light and where I can make myself understood.

In case you seek to relocate me, here’s my [résumé](/resume).

I [write about things](/articles). I do so very rarely.

I keep [a record of my favourite music/books](/list-of-lists) (2014 – present).

Write love mail to <a href="mailto:{{ metadata.author.mail }}" rel="me">{{ metadata.author.mail }}</a>.
