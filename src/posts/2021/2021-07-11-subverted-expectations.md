As an avid album listener, having familiar songs appear in playlists regularly throws me for a loop because the next song playing doesn’t end up being the one I know from the album order. I wonder if that’s a common feeling to have for people in my age. Most people don’t seem to listen to albums anymore. Or are they and my perception is skewed?
