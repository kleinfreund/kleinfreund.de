You asked me to write down some recommendations because you liked the music I was playing while you were around. So here it is. Not on a piece of paper, though.

## [Bachar Mar-Khalifé – Ya Balad](https://infine-rec.bandcamp.com/album/ya-balad-lp-cd)

My favorite album from last year. A very special record indeed. This needs to introduction. We had this one up a few times. Just so very good.

## [Lucius – Full Performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKH0-dV4n9k) (Live on KEXP)

I’m still so impressed by their style not only musically but also visually. Their twin look is so beautiful. Also, I feel their live recordings are so much better than the studio ones.

## [Martin Kohlstedt – Nacht](https://martinkohlstedt.bandcamp.com/album/nacht)

I saw this guy walking around the city almost daily last week. He really did put out two great records while especially “Exa” on this one is formidable.

## [Nubiyan Twist – Self-titled](https://wormfoodrecords.bandcamp.com/album/nubiyan-twist-wf103)

Putting my speakers in the kitchen and cooking with friends. This is the soundtrack. Apart from no cooking taking place because everyone is just shaking their booties.

## [Vangelis – Blade Runnder Soundtrack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EV95Yu6gZSY&list=PL3ABE2FBA2900C03E)

There are a lot of very good soundtracks for movies and also games. I’m sure I’m listening to the soundtrack for the very first Star Wars movie atleast a dozen times a year. This one is for a movie I haven’t even seen yet but the soundtrack is just so good and special. I kinda feel spoiled by knowing it before watching Blade Runner.

## [Bonobo – The North Borders](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-s3h4nDbH4)

One of my most favorite artists. He released many good albums over the years (Animal Magic and Black Sands are both great as well), a great [Late Night Tales mixtape](https://latenighttales.bandcamp.com/album/late-night-tales-bonobo) and an absolutely fantastic live DVD from a show they (Simon Green and band) played at Koko in London (I had a roommate who saw them their. I was so jealous.).

## [Nujabes/Fat Jon – Departure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3fZ8LXNs_E)

Now for a something else. This is a soundtrack for the anime Samurai Champloo which I really like. Give it a listen. Some laid-back instrumental rap.

## The WAYO – [Wanderings](https://thewayo.bandcamp.com/album/wanderings-ep)/<wbr>[Wanderflips](https://thewayo.bandcamp.com/album/wanderflips-ep) EP

Two EP’s from The WAYO while the latter being a remix version of the first one. Good stuff.

## [Cacartu](https://cacartu.bandcamp.com/album/cacartu) Self-titled EP

Percussion-heavy R&B/Soul/Jazz stuff. Enjoying that quite a bit.

## [Kamasi Wahsington – The Epic](https://soundcloud.com/brainfeeder/kamasi-washington-miss-understanding)

This is “The Epic”. That name is chosen adequately. Three hours long, this album requires patience. Listening to it in its entirety almost requires preparation, because you just need the time. We should meet for a cooking session. A long one. No leaving early. No switching off the music. Thinking free style pizza completely self-made with pumpkin slices and sheep’s cheese.
