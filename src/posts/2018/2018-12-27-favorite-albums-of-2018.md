### [Aïsha Devi – DNA Feelings](https://aishadevi.bandcamp.com/album/dna-feelings)

A gorgeous and haunting album. Listening to this music feels like space travel. The most otherworldly album on this list.



### [Hilary Woods – Colt](https://hilarywoodsmusic.bandcamp.com/album/colt)

A slow burner, haunting like Aïsha Devi’s “DNA Feelings”, but in a very different way. The music of “Colt” plays on a far away plane, in a corner of your world where miraculously you hear perfectly well, yet everything seems so distant.



### [Against All Logic – 2012–2017](https://open.spotify.com/album/1uzfGk9vxMXfaZ2avqwxod)

### [Jon Hopkins – Singularity](https://jonhopkins.bandcamp.com/album/singularity)

At its core, a typical Jon Hopkins record. As such, it’s a perfect companion on a long ride on a highway. The first half of the album is a large build-up spanned across multiple tracks until it takes a turn to a more quiet side with “Feel First Life”.



### [Anderson .Paak – Oxnard](https://open.spotify.com/album/3rqqwtJE89WoWvMyPTvbZc)
