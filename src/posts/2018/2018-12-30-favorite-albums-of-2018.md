**Jon Hopkins**<br>
[Singularity](https://jonhopkins.bandcamp.com/album/singularity)

At its core, a record very much typical for Jon Hopkins. As such, it’s a perfect companion on an extended ride on the highway. The first half of the album is a large build-up spanned across multiple tracks until it takes a turn to a more quiet side with “Feel First Life”.



## 9.

**Aïsha Devi**<br>
[DNA Feelings](https://aishadevi.bandcamp.com/album/dna-feelings)

A gorgeous and haunting album. Listening to this music feels like space travel. This is the most otherworldly and dark album on this list.



## 8.

**Hilary Woods**<br>
[Colt](https://hilarywoodsmusic.bandcamp.com/album/colt)

The music of “Colt” plays on a far away plane, in a corner of your world where miraculously you hear perfectly well, yet everything seems so distant. In its own different way, “Colt” is as haunting as Aïsha Devi’s “DNA Feelings”.



## 7.

**Fielded**<br>
[Drip Drip](https://deathbombarc.bandcamp.com/album/drip-drip)

Besides the beautiful album artwork, “Drip Drip” is a wonderfully diverse record with various styles of instrumentation and Lindsay’s vocals being the well-performed centerpiece of the album.



## 6.

**Rosalía**<br>
El Mal Querer



## 5.

**Screaming Females**<br>
[All At Once](https://screamingfemales.bandcamp.com/album/all-at-once)

Hands down the best rock music I listened to in a long time.



## 4.

**Fatima**<br>
[And Yet It’s All Love](https://fatima.bandcamp.com/album/and-yet-its-all-love)

Modern soul, jazzy beats, melodic raps. Fatima delivers a much-needed change in pace to the current Rap/R&B/Soul circus in the form of her new record “And Yet It’s All Love”.



## 3.

**Melody’s Echo Chamber**<br>
[Bon Voyage](https://melodysechochamber.bandcamp.com/album/bon-voyage)

In its short duration, “Bon Voyage” contains the most fun, quirk, and joy of any album I listened to this year. The track “Desert Horse” alone carries so much energy. Get that bass line onto your eardrums.

## 2.

**MGMT**<br>
Little Dark Age

Well, what do you say? Incredibly cool and modern synth-pop record. The first half of it is simply outstanding.



## 1.

**Kali Uchis**<br>
Isolation

And there we have it, coming in at my number one spot is Kali Uchis’ “Isolation”. I spent a short week at the baltic sea with some friends and we were zapping through some music TV. At one point, “After The Storm” was playing and I made a note simply rading “Kali Uchis”. Only a month ago did I bother to check her out. As luck has it sometimes. So many infectious and stellar tracks: “Body Language”, “Just A Stranger”, “Your Teeth In My Neck”, “Dead To Me”, “In My Dreams”, “Tomorrow”, “After the Storm”. In short, I like everything on that album.

Until next year, hopefully. Have a wonderful 2019, beautiful. :)
