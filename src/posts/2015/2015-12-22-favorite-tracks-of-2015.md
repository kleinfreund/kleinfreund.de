## 10.

**37 Adventures**<br>
[Clanky Love (Jamie Lidell’s Klankenzeit Dub)](https://37adventures.bandcamp.com/album/royce-wood-junior-clanky-love-jamie-lidell-remix)

The track starts a bit *flat* but patience is very rewarding. The piano line kicking in later and the vocals are amazing.



## 9.

**Vakula**<br>
[Joywind](https://www.discogs.com/release/6572553-Vakula-A-Voyage-To-Arcturus)

This is a vacation track, isn’t it? It sure sounds like one. Good for me. Haven’t left the country this year.



## 8.

**The Classical**<br>
[Our Lady of Revenge](https://theclassical.bandcamp.com/album/diptych)

This track is a beast! I’m very impressed by the strange repetitive instrumentation, but also the crisp vocals. Shivering under my blanket (Yes, this is exactly what I’ve written on my Bandcamp page).



## 7.

**Ishinohana**<br>
[Lucía (John Talabot’s Sunset Edit)](https://soundcloud.com/john-talabot/ishinohana-lucia-john-talabots-sunset-edit)

Especially liking how the melody evolves over time on this track. Very nice.



## 6.

**Melanie Biasio**<br>
[I’m Gonna Leave You (The Cinematic Orchestra Remix)](https://melaniedebiasio.bandcamp.com/track/im-gonna-leave-you-the-cinematic-orchestra-remix)

Longest track on this list is this great remix by The Cinematic Orchestra. Feels like it never ends. In a good way.



## 5.

**Anderson Paak/ScHoolboy Q**<br>
[Am I Wrong](https://soundcloud.com/andersonpaak/am-i-wrong-anderson-paak)

Do you feel the funky grooves? Yes, I feel them, too. And dance!



## 4.

**Royce Wood Junio**<br>
[Midnight (Special Request Remix)](https://37adventures.bandcamp.com/album/royce-wood-junior-midnight-special-request-remix)

Royce Wood Junior making his second appearance in this list. Again he’s being remixed and again it’s done so well.

**Shlohmo**<br>
[Buried](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVR10CD2Alk)

Slow build-ups. You know me. They have a special place in my heart.

The last piece music which has made me felt so in peace with everything were the fantastic compositions for Minecraft by Daniel Rosenfeld who just released his [new album 148](https://c418.bandcamp.com/album/148). This song accompanied by this immensely beautiful video does just that again. Make me feel peaceful.



## 1.

**Cumeo Project**<br>
[On the Surface of the Sea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBsViwfTeBQ)

This melody. I don’t know what to say. It gets me every time. So energetic, so beautiful.

That’s it for the favorite tracks. Albums following soon. Could’ve easily been a top 50 judging by new additions to my library but I leave it at that.

I would love to hear what you’ve been listening to through out the year. Let me know.
