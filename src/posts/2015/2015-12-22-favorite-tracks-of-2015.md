## 11. [Fresh Cut Orchestra – The Mothers’ Suite, Movement III – Ritual of Take](https://freshcutorchestra.bandcamp.com/album/from-the-vine)

## 10. [37 Adventures – Clanky Love (Jamie Lidell’s Klankenzeit Dub)](https://37adventures.bandcamp.com/album/royce-wood-junior-clanky-love-jamie-lidell-remix)

![Detail from the artwork](/img/posts/tracks-2015/10.jpg)

The track starts a bit *flat* but patience is very rewarding. The piano line kicking in later and the vocals are amazing.



## 9. [Vakula – Joywind](http://www.discogs.com/Vakula-A-Voyage-To-Arcturus/release/6572553)

![Detail from the artwork](/img/posts/tracks-2015/09.jpg)

This is a vacation track, isn’t it? It sure sounds like one. Good for me. Haven’t left the country this year.



## 8. [The Classical – Our Lady of Revenge](https://theclassical.bandcamp.com/album/diptych)

![Detail from the artwork](/img/posts/tracks-2015/08.jpg)

This track is a beast! I’m very impressed by the strange repetitive instrumentation, but also the crisp vocals. Shivering under my blanket (Yes, this is exactly what I’ve written on my Bandcamp page).



## 7. [Ishinohana – Lucía (John Talabot’s Sunset Edit)](https://soundcloud.com/john-talabot/ishinohana-lucia-john-talabots-sunset-edit)

![Detail from the artwork](/img/posts/tracks-2015/07.jpg)

Especially liking how the melody evolves over time on this track. Very nice.



## 6. [Melanie Biasio – I’m Gonna Leave You (The Cinematic Orchestra Remix)](https://melaniedebiasio.bandcamp.com/track/im-gonna-leave-you-the-cinematic-orchestra-remix)

![Detail from the artwork](/img/posts/tracks-2015/06.jpg)

Longest track on this list is this great remix by The Cinematic Orchestra. Feels like it never ends. In a good way.



## 5. [Anderson Paak/ScHoolboy Q – Am I Wrong](https://soundcloud.com/andersonpaak/am-i-wrong-anderson-paak)

![Detail from the artwork](/img/posts/tracks-2015/05.jpg)

Do you feel the funky grooves? Yes, I feel them, too. And dance!



## 4. [Royce Wood Junio – Midnight (Special Request Remix)](https://37adventures.bandcamp.com/album/royce-wood-junior-midnight-special-request-remix)

![Detail from the artwork](/img/posts/tracks-2015/04.jpg)

Royce Wood Junior making his second appearance in this list. Again he’s being remixed and again it’s done so well.

## 3. [Shlohmo – Buried](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVR10CD2Alk)

![Detail from the artwork](/img/posts/tracks-2015/03.jpg)

Slow build-ups. You know me. They have a special place in my heart (Not biologically, that’d be crazy).



## 2. [Beatsofreen – Slowly Rising](http://store.kingdeluxe.ca/album/full-circle)

The last piece music which has made me felt so in peace with everything were the fantastic compositions for Minecraft by Daniel Rosenfeld who just released his [new album 148](https://c418.bandcamp.com/album/148). This song accompanied by this immensely beautiful video does just that again. Make me feel peaceful.



## 1. [Cumeo Project – On the Surface of the Sea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBsViwfTeBQ)

![Detail from the artwork](/img/posts/tracks-2015/01.jpg)

This melody. I don’t know what to say. It gets me every time. So energetic, so beautiful.

That’s it for the favorite tracks. Albums following soon. Could’ve easily been a top 50 judging by new additions to my library but I leave it at that.

I would love to hear what you’ve been listening to through out the year. Let me know.
