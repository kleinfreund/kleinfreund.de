    <p>Here we are again. One year done again. It got quite quiet here. Three articles. Nothing more. But I won’t apologize or promise to do better. Often I feel the urge to write something, but I just don’t know what. Strange, but it is what it is and I’m fine with that.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Good things happened this year. I’m talking about music and a very personal improvement in life quality that is only partially related to music. This is now the time to, for a short while atleast, leave behind the year as a whole with all the bad things that came out of it. To take away what it had to offer for our ears.</p>

<p>For me it felt a bit like there was <em>less</em> music this year. I just had other things on my mind. Still, there is some records I want to tell you about.</p>

<h3 id="gold-panda-good-luck-and-do-your-best-https-goldpanda-bandcamp-com-album-good-luck-and-do-your-best"><a href="https://goldpanda.bandcamp.com/album/good-luck-and-do-your-best">Gold Panda – Good Luck And Do Your Best</a></h3>

<p><img src="/img/posts/albums-2016/good-luck-and-do-your-best.jpg" alt="Gold Panda – Good Luck And Do Your Best album artwork" /></p>

<p>“In My Car” is great. A wonderful melody. I wish it would never end. But then again there is quite some melodies for which this is true.</p>

<p>The record is not without its flaws. It feels a bit incoherent at points. There are a lot of good ideas, interesting little rhythm patterns. I like all these small repetitive melodies that come and come again like on “Pink &amp; Green” or “I Am Real Punk”. The songs are well-executed. In total, they don’t add together as a whole but it’s a pleasent experience nonetheless.</p>

<p>And then there is “Time Eater” and the cover version by <a href="https://ssighborggg.bandcamp.com">Ssighborggg</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/luna422422">Luna Lee</a>. This for me is the high mark of the record. Both tracks, incredibly well-performed. I dig it.</p>

<h3 id="bon-iver-22-a-million-https-boniver-bandcamp-com-album-22-a-million"><a href="https://boniver.bandcamp.com/album/22-a-million">Bon Iver – 22, A Million</a></h3>

<p><img src="/img/posts/albums-2016/22-a-million.jpg" alt="Bon Iver – 22, A Million album artwork" /></p>

<p>Up until 2016 I never paid attention to Justin Vernon. There is no particular reason for that. It just didn’t happen. Until early June when I met you. We attended the Michelberger Music festival in Berlin where he played a good half of his new record. I’m into this kind of rough and unpolished experimenting, although in it’s completeness the album leaves a bit of an unfinished impression upon me. It has some bright moments. There is nothing like getting clocked on the highway because “10 d E A T h b R E a s T ⚄ ⚄”’s driving beat puts you just in that mood.</p>

<p>Or sitting besides you and start singing “I’d be happy as hell if you’d stay for tea” at just the right moment of ‘33 &ldquo;GOD&rdquo;’. And not to forget about that incredible performance of “8 (circle)” accompanied by a humming and stunning choir at Funkhaus Berlin during the festival.</p>

<h3 id="badbadnotgood-iv-https-badbadnotgoodil-bandcamp-com-album-iv"><a href="https://badbadnotgoodil.bandcamp.com/album/iv">BADBADNOTGOOD – IV</a></h3>

<p><img src="/img/posts/albums-2016/iv.jpg" alt="BADBADNOTGOOD – IV album artwork" /></p>

<p><a href="https://badbadnotgoodil.bandcamp.com/album/iii">III</a> was one of my most favorite albums of 2015. Getting my hands on their follow-up IV was only natural. IV came with quite some changes. It’s different. More … elegant, more complex, has more variety. Not as energetic as the predecessor. In it’s own right a very solid and also surprising album. Also, the features are on point. “Time Moves Slow” with Sam Herring or “In Your Eyes” with Charlotte Day Wilson. Very good.</p>

<h3 id="various-artists-furi-original-soundtrack-https-furi-bandcamp-com-album-furi-original-soundtrack"><a href="https://furi.bandcamp.com/album/furi-original-soundtrack">Various Artists – Furi Original Soundtrack</a></h3>

<p><img src="/img/posts/albums-2016/furi-ost.jpg" alt="Furi Original Soundtrack album artwork" /></p>

<p>After last year’s ear-opening <a href="https://dbsoundworks.bandcamp.com/album/crypt-of-the-necrodancer-ost">Crypt of the Necrodancer soundtrack</a> by Danny Baranowsky, this feels like 2015 all over. Dare I say this is even more aggressive? Hard to decide. Doesn’t matter. It’s brutal and a lot of fun. This one lines up with a couple other game soundtracks I enjoy a lot where I haven’t played the game. So many good game soundtracks around these days. It’s amazing. Plus if I were collecting vinyl, this would be a new addition. The jacket and the vinyl itself look fantastic.</p>

<h3 id="grand-killa-con-la-barranca-https-drmdlr-bandcamp-com-album-la-barranca"><a href="https://drmdlr.bandcamp.com/album/la-barranca">Grand Killa Con – La Barranca</a></h3>

<p><img src="/img/posts/albums-2016/la-barranca.jpg" alt="Grand Killa Con – La Barranca album artwork" /></p>

<p>When it comes to hip hop, I’m often conflicted. Most of the stuff that’s around I don’t like. Not at all. Here it’s different, though. I like myself some Four Owls, some Sound Defects, some <a href="https://onra.bandcamp.com">Onra</a> who seemed to have left some impressions on GKC. Especially on “Dead Pheasant” that aesthetic comes through. Nice record we got here.</p>

<h3 id="mammal-hands-floa-https-mammalhands-bandcamp-com-album-floa"><a href="https://mammalhands.bandcamp.com/album/floa">Mammal Hands – Floa</a></h3>

<p><img src="/img/posts/albums-2016/floa.jpg" alt="Mammal Hands – Floa album artwork" /></p>

<p>That’s … simply consistent. Hard to pick favorite tracks here. Or least-favorite tracks for that matter. That’s just a very well-rounded album. Would love to hear them live. For the one show they play in Germany I can’t seem to find any information apart from the entry on their website. Oh well. Anyway, I have the album. I can listen to the music. That’ll suffice for now.</p>

<h3 id="angel-olsen-my-woman-https-angelolsen-bandcamp-com-album-my-woman"><a href="https://angelolsen.bandcamp.com/album/my-woman">Angel Olsen – My Woman</a></h3>

<p><img src="/img/posts/albums-2016/my-woman.jpg" alt="Angel Olsen – My Woman album artwork" /></p>

<p>How can a performance like “Shut Up Kiss Me” not leave a strong impression on anyone? The album starts louder with a fresh attitude and undergoes a change of pace towards a more quiet side with beautiful songs like “Sister” giving me the chills. A beautiful record. Angel Olsen is a name you should definitely look out for in the next few years. Looking forward to new material.</p>

<h3 id="fakear-vegetal-offshoots-https-fakear-bandcamp-com-album-vegetal-offshoots"><a href="https://fakear.bandcamp.com/album/vegetal-offshoots">Fakear – Vegetal: Offshoots</a></h3>

<p><img src="/img/posts/albums-2016/vegetal-offshoots.jpg" alt="Vegetal: Offshoots album artwork" /></p>

<p>The first late addition to this list. Straight from the Bandcamp Top-100 via wishlist into my music library. One of my favorite electronica releases this year. Not so sure about that “Animal” record, but what is presented here as B-sides is super good. Feels more like an album on its own.</p>

<h3 id="chris-remo-firewatch-original-score-https-camposantogames-bandcamp-com-album-firewatch-original-score"><a href="https://camposantogames.bandcamp.com/album/firewatch-original-score">Chris Remo – Firewatch Original Score</a></h3>

<p><img src="/img/posts/albums-2016/firewatch-ost.jpg" alt="Firewatch Original Score album artwork" /></p>

<p>Hands down the best soundtrack I listened to this year. Belongs to one of the view games I played this year. Hasn’t been much. I played Dark Souls for the first time. Firewatch shortly after it came out. I played quite some Dota 2 where I just lost over and over. Losing 11 games in a row only to lose another 11 after winning just one. I had a 54% win/lose ratio. Now I’m down to 48%. This wasn’t a year of gaming for me. Other things on my mind, on my ears. I wouldn’t say I was ever a hardcore gamer.</p>

<p>Anyway, this record is just as beautiful as it gets. Or as beautiful as the experience I had when walking through Shoshone National Park while this soundtrack did part of the magic. And an important part it was. It’s always nice to return to a game by listening to the music again.</p>

<h3 id="a-tribe-called-quest-we-got-it-from-here-thank-you-4-your-service-https-play-spotify-com-album-3wvqpufospzkzvcsuyncf3"><a href="https://play.spotify.com/album/3WvQpufOsPzkZvcSuynCf3">A Tribe Called Quest – We got it from Here… Thank You 4 Your service</a></h3>

<p><img src="/img/posts/albums-2016/we-got-it-from-here.jpg" alt="A Tribe Called Quest – We got it from Here… Thank You 4 Your service album artwork" /></p>

<p>Before I only was aware of the fact that there is something with the name “A Tribe Called Quest”. Maybe I knew it got something to do with music. Anyway, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0vMdRfwFxY">Anthony Fantano’s review</a> sparked interest and I gave it a listen. They certainly don’t disappoint. Yet another good hip hop record for my library. “We The People&hellip;.” really gets me with its instrumentals. Same goes for “Dis Generation”. I’ve come to realize that it’s instrumentals that are doing the most for me on a hip hop record. And in that regard, this record is very good.</p>

<h3 id="olga-bell-tempo-https-bell-bandcamp-com-album-tempo"><a href="https://bell.bandcamp.com/album/tempo">Olga Bell – Tempo</a></h3>

<p><img src="/img/posts/albums-2016/tempo.jpg" alt="Olga Bell – Tempo album artwork" /></p>

<p>I have to say, I’m impressed. This record was well into the run for one of my favorite albums of the year and I had it at the top spot when writing the draft for this post for most of the time. This isn’t really a battle for what album is <em>the best</em>, so the order of albums presented here is nothing definitive, nothing clear. Simpy put: This is one of the best records of the year. It’s <em>the</em> best pop record of the year.</p>

<p>This is what I call refreshing. It’s is very much the eclectic electronic pop record I needed. Not as weird as your FKA twigs yet not as streamlined as any of the others. It has oh so much variety. I love love love it. And right when you thought this was it, the album is coming to its end, it has surprised and amazed you, then there comes “America”. A beautiful ballad.</p>

<h3 id="subrosa-for-this-we-fought-the-battle-of-ages-https-profoundlorerecords-bandcamp-com-album-for-this-we-fought-the-battle-of-ages"><a href="https://profoundlorerecords.bandcamp.com/album/for-this-we-fought-the-battle-of-ages">SubRosa – For This We Fought The Battle Of Ages</a></h3>

<p><img src="/img/posts/albums-2016/for-this-we-fought-the-battle-of-ages.jpg" alt="For This We Fought The Battle Of Ages album artwork" /></p>

<p>Wow, this came out of nowhere. Good thing I browsed the <a href="https://daily.bandcamp.com/2016/12/08/the-best-albums-of-2016-40-21/">Bandcamp Top-100</a>. This is exactly the kind of music I wanted some Godspeed You! Black Emperor songs to evolve into while playing them.</p>

<p>Why is “Despair Is A Siren” not the first thing that plays on their album page on Bandcamp? When I listened to that song riding home through the night from my girlfriends place, I was taken aback. This was so intense, so unique. I wanted to scream. 15 minutes for only the first song. I couldn’t even finish it on my 10 minute way home. But you can be damn sure that I used my time alone in our apartment to play this loud. Love it.</p>

<hr />

<p>That’s it. This year there won’t be a list for tracks and EP’s. I will put up some honorable mentiones and thoughts up.</p>

<p>This year was different for me for many reasons. Globally and personally. I attended more concerts than in any other year. Apart from two festivals and not counting in some shows I saw with my parents, I only went to a The Prodigy show in 2009. This year, I went to <a href="https://rudolstadt-festival.de/en/">Rudolstadt Festival</a> with you. We went to Berlin for <a href="http://michelbergermusic.com/">Michelberger Music</a>, saw The Lumineers in Hamburg and <a href="https://marbert-rocel.bandcamp.com/">Marbert Rocel</a> just a few days ago in Erfurt. With my parents and my sister I went to see The Cure in Munich.</p>

<p>With you, I want to see so much more acts in concert. Most of them we probably don’t even know about, yet. I want to see <a href="http://www.nilsfrahm.com/">Nils Frahm</a> with you. <a href="https://martinkohlstedt.bandcamp.com/">Martin Kohlstedt</a>. I wouldn’t pass up seeing Anoushka Shankar again. Or Glen Hansard.</p>

<p>I’m really looking forward to the upcoming Bonobo album <a href="https://bonobomusic.bandcamp.com/album/migration">“Migration”</a> dropping in two weeks. Seeing him and band in February as well as <a href="https://boniver.bandcamp.com">Bon Iver</a>. I’ll also attend Rudolstadt Festival again. That’s a no-brainer, really. I’d love to hear something new from <a href="https://lauragroves.bandcamp.com">Laura Groves</a>. Also what about that new Gorillaz record? Wasn’t there quite some fuzz about that a few months back? Anyway, have a good time folks. Tell me what you listened to this year.</p>
