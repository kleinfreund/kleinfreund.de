title: 'Website: artrudloff'
---

I built [artrudloff.de](http://artrudloff.de) for my parents in 2012 to serve as a showcase for their work. Andreas is doing etchings, woodcuttings, aquarelles, poster artwork and drawings. Anke does very detailed drawings and paintings, wooden reliefs and other objects. Recently she’s also doing designs for bell adornments for churches.

The site was running Wordpress originally, but I decided to rebuild it with Jekyll and host it on GitHub. This came with significant performance improvements. It also makes content updates easier for me.
