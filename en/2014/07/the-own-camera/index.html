    <h2>The own camera</h2>

    <p>I have my own camera for a few months now. My first thought was in the direction of a cute mirrorless (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sony-NEX-3NL-Compact-Interchangeable-Digital/dp/B00BF9MUBM">Sony NEX-3N</a>).</p>

<p>One makes a couple of compromises in this price segment. The cameras are small and light, but the handling is orientated as a consumer product for the masses. Touch screen, confusing menu navigation, partially poor processing.</p>

<p>My budget was somewhat small, but for 280 € all seemed pretty okay. Because the Amazon price was up by the time I wanted to place the order, I ordered from Conrad. Not a good idea.</p>

<p>After two weeks of not receiving a confirmation, I called them. They told me that they were out of stock and that they cancelled my order. Bad thing about that? They didn’t tell me.</p>

<p>Back to the beginning. That somewhat stole my thunder and my eyes were back on single-lens reflex cameras. Eventually I bought the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Canon-Digital-Imaging-18-55mm-3-5-5-6/dp/B004J3V90Y">Canon EOS Rebel T3i</a> from Media Markt including a bag, a cleaning cloth and a SD card for 400 gold coins—the camera alone costs around 550 € currently, so much for that.</p>

<p>The camera has a good screen—also counting the selfie feature (one can pull it out)—which I use as a viewfinder surprisingly frequent (Live View is not that bad).</p>

<p>Navigation is flexible just like we’re used to from DSLR’s. The kit lense does a good job, unless when used in low light. Understandable.</p>

<p>My next investigation will be <s>replacing my ailing mobile phone</s> the expecting <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Canon-50mm-1-8-Camera-Lens/dp/B00007E7JU">Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 II</a></p>

<p>Although the photographs are linked accordingly, let me suggest my <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/kleinfreund">Flickr account</a>. Have a look!</p>
