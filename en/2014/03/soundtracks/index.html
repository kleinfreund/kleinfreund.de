    <h1>Soundtracks</h1>

    <p>I don’t know about you, but my Steam library is stuffed with numerous, untouched games. I’m looking at you, Humble Bundle. Although omnipresent through shop and Weekly Deals, it’s still a good thing.</p>

<p>The point is, I listen to the music more often than playing the actual games. Also this leaves me in the awkward spot of talking about music I actually bought.</p>

<h2>Darren Korb: Bastion</h2>

<p><a href="http://supergiantgames.bandcamp.com/album/bastion-original-soundtrack/"><img src="/img/posts/darren-korb-bastion-soundtrack-cover.jpg" alt="Darren Korb: Bastion Soundtrack" /></a></p>

<p>Bastion is an artistic masterpiece. Although basically a Hack and Slay, it’s a pretty good one. The story, the narration, the gameplay. Wicked. I’m sorry for those of you who missed or ignored the <em>Humble Indie Bundle V</em> back then.</p>

<p>Great, that the soundtrack even tops that. Downright recommended. Favorite track is <em>Mother, I’m Here (Zulf’s Theme)</em>. Oh, dear. Also, one of the few games I actually played through. I’m looking forward to <a href="http://supergiantgames.com/index.php/transistor/">Transistor</a>.</p>

<h2>Floex: Zorya</h2>

<p><a href="http://store.floex.cz/album/zorya/"><img src="/img/posts/floex-zorya-cover.jpg" alt="Floex: Zorya" /></a></p>

<p>Not really a soundtrack for a game, but was part of the <em>Humble Amanita Bundle</em>. However, they made the soundtrack for Samorost II and Machinarium.</p>

<p>Harmonious, mystic clarinette tootling. I like it a lot. Best song? <em>Precious Creature</em>.</p>

<h2>Jim Guthrie: Sword &amp; Sworcery LP</h2>

<p><a href="http://jimguthrie.bandcamp.com/album/sword-sworcery-lp-the-ballad-of-the-space-babies/"><img src="/img/posts/jim-guthrie-sword-and-sworcery-lp-cover.jpg" alt="Jim Guthrie: Sword &amp; Sworcery LP" /></a></p>

<p>A bit of similarity to the Zorya album, it sounds more like a <em>game</em> soundtrack. However, opinions differ on whether Sword &amp; Sworcery LP is even a game anyway.</p>

<p>Pleasent companion for quiet afternoons or weekends. But that may account for all the presented things here. My favorite is <em>Dark Flute</em>. It gets really funky with <em>Com64</em> from the bonus material.</p>

<h2>Carlo Castellano: The Swapper</h2>

<p><a href="http://store.carlocastellano.cc/album/the-swapper-original-soundtrack/"><img src="/img/posts/carlo-castellano-the-swapper-soundtrack-cover.jpg" alt="Carlo Castellano: The Swapper" /></a></p>

<p>This game was recommended from many places because of the soundtrack. I haven’t played the game, but listened through the soundtrack. Confirmed.</p>

<p>Spherical, mystical sounds. Title 6 is one of those fascinating piano tracks: <em>Recreation</em>. Whoever likes these as well should give <a href="https://soundcloud.com/oskarschuster/">Oskar Schuster</a> a listen.</p>

<h2>C418: Volume Beta</h2>

<p><a href="http://c418.bandcamp.com/album/minecraft-volume-beta/"><img src="/img/posts/c418-volume-beta-cover.jpg" alt="C418: Volume Beta" /></a></p>

<p>As if the first soundtrack for Minecraft wasn’t good enough, Daniel Rosenfeld does it again. I even like it a bit more than <em>Volume Alpha</em>. That thing got 140 minutes playing time. Over two hours. Almost one tenth day.</p>

<h2>Tiny &amp; Big: Music To Cut Rocks By</h2>

<p><a href="http://blackpantsgamestudio.bandcamp.com/album/tiny-big-soundtrack/"><img src="/img/posts/tiny-and-big-soundtrack-cover.jpg" alt="Tiny &amp; Big: Music To Cut Rocks By" /></a></p>

<p>This one steps out of the line. Weird music to a probably even weirder game. It’s a compilation of multiple artists. It gets quite crazy indeed. Favorite is <em>Lusitiana</em>.</p>

<h2>Other</h2>

<p>I was really impressed by the soundtrack for <em>Gothic II</em> as well. One of my favorite games. Another honorable mention would be the funny and rocky music from <em>Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert 3</em>. Same goes for <em>Dust: An Elysian Tail</em>. I should give it another try.</p>

<p>From the field of films, most of you will know the big ones like Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, The Hobbit, etc. Don’t forget <em>Le Fabuleux Destin d’Amélie Poulain</em> by Yann Tiersen.</p>

<hr />

<p>Did I forget something? What’s your favorite game tunes? Favorite film music? Favorite music? Favorite whatnot?!</p>
