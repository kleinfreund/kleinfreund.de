I do Web Development and Design. Currently in an apprenticeship, study Media Informatics after that.

I’ve put plenty of [CSS](http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS) and [SASS](http://sass-lang.com "Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets") into my bag of tricks. Besides that, it contains [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), [Wordpress](http://de.wordpress.org) and [Tumblr](http://tumblr.com).

Intricate knots are unravled by [GitHub]({{ site.author.github }}), [Stack Overflow]({{ site.author.stackoverflow }}) and [Code Review]({{ site.author.codereview }}). The supporting actors [Don’t Repeat Yourself](http://csswizardry.com/2013/07/writing-dryer-vanilla-css "Writing DRYer vanilla CSS by Harry Roberts") and [Block Element Modifier](http://bem.info "BEM. Block, Element, Modifier") help maintaining overview.

Around Twitter as [kleinfreund]({{ site.author.twitter }}). Putting up some photographs on [Flickr]({{ site.author.flickr }}). Collecting nice things with Tumblr on [infinite amplitudes](http://infiniteamplitudes.tumblr.com) (Careful, NSFW).
