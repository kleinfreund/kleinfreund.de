## [Ancient Astronauts: Best Of 2001–2011](https://switchstancerecordings.bandcamp.com/album/best-of-2001-2011)

Not so ancient are these two guys from Cologne Germany. The put together a small Best Of with six tracks of which “Return To Blackspin” cought my ear the most. The base theme of that song alone is so well done that the first seconds are enough for me to like it.

## [The Raah Project: Take Me Elsewhere](https://theraahproject.bandcamp.com/album/take-me-elsewhere)

<p><iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 42px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3750759038/size=small/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol={{ site.ui_color }}/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="http://theraahproject.bandcamp.com/album/take-me-elsewhere">The Raah Project: Take Me Elsewhere</a></iframe></p>

Hip Hop-infused jazz orchestration brought to you by Tamil Rogeon and Ryan Ritchie plus a horn band and string section. This album has a lot of variety and sometimes feels like a game/movie soundtrack. It adds up to over an hour of material.

## [Ola Szmidt: Toi Toi Remix EP](https://olaszmidt.bandcamp.com/album/toi-toi-remix-ep)

<p><iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 42px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2179426243/size=small/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol={{ site.ui_color }}/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="http://olaszmidt.bandcamp.com/album/toi-toi-remix-ep">Ola Szmidt: Toi Toi Remix EP</a></iframe></p>

Lovely little piece by Ola Szmidt for her six year old daughter. 1 song, 5 versions. That kinda makes me wanna have children and sing songs for them. That’s most likely not going to happen this year. I clap along through the rest of the article with my 387 hands now.

## [Dom La Nena: Soyo](https://domlanenamusic.bandcamp.com/album/soyo)

<p><iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 42px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1343609964/size=small/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol={{ site.ui_color }}/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="http://domlanenamusic.bandcamp.com/album/soyo">Dom La Nena: Soyo</a></iframe></p>

Very soft and friendly album of singer-songwriter Dominique Pinto makes you sway away into other spheres. Although I don’t understand what she’s singing about, some of these songs let me sensor a vague idea of what might be going on. Beautiful album.

## [Lemâitre: Discography](https://lemaitremusic.bandcamp.com/music)

<p><iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 42px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=983927866/size=small/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol={{ site.ui_color }}/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="http://lemaitremusic.bandcamp.com/music">Lemâitre: Relativity 1</a></iframe></p>

I’ve been following the work of Ketil Jansen and Ulrik Denizou Lund for quite a while now after they have been introduced to me through [musigh.com](http://musigh.com) and Johannes Greve Muskat’s video for the track [Come Again](https://vimeo.com/16140069). Now I bought their back catalogue. Would’ve bought the loose tracks as well, if they were on their Bandcamp. They make … quite different and unique music and birds are telling me that there is a new album in the making. A new album? The first ablum that would be. I’m stoked!

## [Scheeba: Queen of Scheeba](https://scheeba.bandcamp.com/album/queen-of-scheeba)

<p><iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 42px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1969881413/size=small/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol={{ site.ui_color }}/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="http://scheeba.bandcamp.com/album/queen-of-scheeba">Scheeba: Queen of Scheeba</a></iframe></p>

Let me tell you, this is one of my favorite album covers (by Léna Sarrault) of this bulk and there were a lot of really good ones. Now to the musical part. What a voice. Wow. The three musicians from French deliver a rock-solid debut Trip-Hop. That would’ve been at one of the top places of last years list week for albums.

## [Weval: Half Age EP](https://atomnation.bandcamp.com/album/half-age-ep)

<p><iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 42px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1250614513/size=small/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol={{ site.ui_color }}/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="http://atomnation.bandcamp.com/album/half-age-ep">Weval: Half Age EP</a></iframe></p>

Atomnation again, this time with Harm Coolen and Merijn Scholte Albers as Weval with their debut release. Especially “Something” grabbed my attention. The minimal aesthetic compared with the edited vocals create deep atmosphere. I like to get lost in there.

## [C418: Mincraft – Volume Beta](https://c418.bandcamp.com/album/minecraft-volume-beta)

<p><iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 42px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=551760206/size=small/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol={{ site.ui_color }}/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="http://c418.bandcamp.com/album/minecraft-volume-beta">C418: Mincraft – Volume Beta</a></iframe></p>

This is a no-brainer. C418? Daniel Rosenfeld? Minecraft? Forever. … as Anthony Fontano would put it. 140 minutes of music and that is only the second part of the soundtrack. Amazeballs. Just buy this piece. Easy.
