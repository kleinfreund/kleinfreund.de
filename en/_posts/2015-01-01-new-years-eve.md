We went for a walk, because surprisingly it snowed quite a bit after a not-so-white December. Although the temperatures were rising again it was cold enough. The snow stayed until the next day.

The sky was covered by low-hanging clouds and it was awkwardly gloomly. It looked like mist and if it was about to start to rain. Magnificent.
