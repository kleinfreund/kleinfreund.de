During the internships I had in my apprenticeship I worked at a local agency. Marco Müller is a photographer and wanted to get rid of his flash monstrosity of a website. After a little ice age [marcografie.de](http://marcografie.de) is available in new guise.

The site runs on Wordpress with the [Responsive Fullscreen Studio](http://themeforest.net/item/responsive-fullscreen-studio-for-wordpress/2026019) theme. I adjusted it to fit Marco’s needs.
