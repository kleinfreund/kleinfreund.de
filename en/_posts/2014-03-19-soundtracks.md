I don’t know about you, but my Steam library is stuffed with numerous, untouched games. I’m looking at you, Humble Bundle. Although omnipresent through shop and Weekly Deals, it’s still a good thing.

The point is, I listen to the music more often than playing the actual games. Also this leaves me in the awkward spot of talking about music I actually bought.

__By the way:__ Click on the images to go to the bandcamp pages of these albums. Buy!

## Darren Korb: Bastion

Bastion is an artistic masterpiece. Although basically a Hack and Slay, it’s a pretty good one. The story, the narration, the gameplay. Wicked. I’m sorry for those of you who missed or ignored the _Humble Indie Bundle V_ back then.

Great, that the soundtrack even tops that. Downright recommended. Favorite track is _Mother, I’m Here (Zulf’s Theme)_. Oh, dear. Also, one of the few games I actually played through. I’m looking forward to [Transistor](http://supergiantgames.com/index.php/transistor).

## Floex: Zorya

Not really a soundtrack for a game, but was part of the _Humble Amanita Bundle_. However, they made the soundtrack for Samorost II and Machinarium.

Harmonious, mystic clarinette tootling. I like it a lot. Best song? _Precious Creature_.

## Jim Guthrie: Sword & Sworcery LP

A bit of similarity to the Zorya album, it sounds more like a _game_ soundtrack. However, opinions differ on whether Sword & Sworcery LP is even a game anyway.

Pleasent companion for quiet afternoons or weekends. But that may account for all the presented things here. My favorite is _Dark Flute_. It gets really funky with _Com64_ from the bonus material.

## Carlo Castellano: The Swapper

This game was recommended from many places because of the soundtrack. I haven’t played the game, but listened through the soundtrack. Confirmed.

Spherical, mystical sounds. Title 6 is one of those fascinating piano tracks: _Recreation_. Whoever likes these as well should give [Oskar Schuster](https://soundcloud.com/oskarschuster) a listen.

## C418: Volume Beta

As if the first soundtrack for Minecraft wasn’t good enough, Daniel Rosenfeld does it again. I even like it a bit more than _Volume Alpha_. That thing got 140 minutes playing time. Over two hours. Almost one tenth day.

## Tiny & Big: Music To Cut Rocks By

This one steps out of the line. Weird music to a probably even weirder game. It’s a compilation of multiple artists. It gets quite crazy indeed. Favorite is _Lusitiana_.

## Other

I was really impressed by the soundtrack for _Gothic II_ as well. One of my favorite games. Another honorable mention would be the funny and rocky music from _Command & Conquer: Red Alert 3_. Same goes for _Dust: An Elysian Tail_. I should give it another try.

From the field of films, most of you will know the big ones like Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, The Hobbit, etc. Don’t forget _Le Fabuleux Destin d’Amélie Poulain_ by Yann Tiersen.

Did I forget something? What’s your favorite game tunes? Favorite film music? Favorite music? Favorite whatnot?!
