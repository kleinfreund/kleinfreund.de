With [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) I get a fully functional and static website from a bunch of kooky files. What Jekyll does is great, because I don’t need more.

I get a blog with pagination. Posts can be written in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). Changes to the page are made in a few template files, not in all my HTML files. This site would work offline as well, if I omit `"/"` from paths and adjust the navigation accordingly. However this isn’t the primary goal of a website, isn’t it?

I can test the whole thing locally by typing `jekyll serve -w` into the command line. Whatever is changed in my project directory is reflected on the local server immediately. Sass is compiled on saving by [Prepros](http://alphapixels.com/prepros/) with a custom [config.rb](http://github.com/kleinfreund/kleinfreund.github.io/blob/master/config.rb). Besides the regular CSS file, I get a compressed version.

The CSS is enhanced by [inuit.css](http://inuitcss.com/). I should probably fork this in the future, because I don’t need anything from it. But Harry is probably releasing inuitcss v5.0 this year. He was removing the dot from _inuit.css_.

Besides that I discovered another member of the Stack Exchange network, which I didn’t know before. [Code&nbsp;Review](http://codereview.stackexchange.com/)! Basically, you get reviews of your own code. Tried it out with this very site ([here](http://codereview.stackexchange.com/q/39890/35408), [here](http://codereview.stackexchange.com/q/40142/35408) and [here](http://codereview.stackexchange.com/q/40574/35408)) and got a few nice answers. You should give it a try. It also has a pretty vital and active chat: [The&nbsp;2nd&nbsp;Monitor](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/8595/).

What tools do you use for your websites? Drop me a line: [@kleinfreund](https://twitter.com/kleinfreund).
