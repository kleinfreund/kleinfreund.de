From time to time I do little cards for birthdays, Christmas, etc. Usually I’m looking for inspiration on Dribbble or while doing Tumblr stuff.

Although I went through the 26 pages for the owl tag on Dribbble, I couldn’t find the author of the original illustration. If you know who did this, feel free to [mail](mailto:phrudloff@gmail.com) me a link.
