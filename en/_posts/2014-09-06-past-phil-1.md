…didn’t know that one can export the iTunes media library to transfer it to another or in his case freshly setup system.

__File__ > __Library__ > __Export Library__

Would’ve been that easy. Instead he copies the _My Music_ directory to an external hard drive and populates an entirely new media library.

This dork.
