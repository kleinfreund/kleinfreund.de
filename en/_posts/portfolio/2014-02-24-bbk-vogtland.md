The local society [Bund Bildender KÃ¼nstler Vogtland e.V.](http://bbk-vogtland.de/) got a redesign. The result is a light, static site.

Only the members page involves a bit jQuery to reveal the member information.

The tricky part was using the CSS3 `transition` property, because the boxes for the detail view vary in height. Instead of transitioning to `height: auto;` one needs to use `max-height`. Not optimal, but it works.
