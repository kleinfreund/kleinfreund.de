I’m happy to hear that the [Klingon Empire](http://en.memory-alpha.org/wiki/Klingon_Empire) is catching up on the trend of wearables in time.

But seriously now, can you please stop using `` ([U+F8FF](http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/f8ff)) as a symbol for Apple?

Because all I see is this:

This is due the character being part of the [Private Use Area](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_Use_Areas) which OS manufacturers are free to assign symbols to. Apple chose to assign an Apple. Microsaft could’ve assigned a pile of poo. Good thing they did not.
