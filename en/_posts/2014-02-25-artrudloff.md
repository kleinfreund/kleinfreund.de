I built [artrudloff.de](http://artrudloff.de) for my parents in Summer 2012. It’s a showcase of their work.

The site is a self-coded theme for Wordpress. Last year I added [inuitcss](http://inuitcss.com) and a custom [Teehan+Lax Navigation](http://alexcican.com/post/teehan-lax-navigation).

Andreas Rudloff does printed graphics, aquarelle and placards.

Bell designs, woodworks, murals and drawings are the work of Anke Rudloff.
