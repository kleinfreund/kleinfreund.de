Today I discovered, that there [a few Jekyll plugins](https://help.github.com/articles/sitemaps-for-github-pages) which run in _safe mode_. GitHub Pages doesn’t normally allow plugins, unless you compile locally.

Because I need the plugins [i18n\_filter.rb](https://github.com/gacha/gacha.id.lv/blob/master/_plugins/i18n_filter.rb) and [generate\_category\_pages.rb](https://github.com/captaincanine/marran.com/blob/master/_plugins/generate_category_pages.rb) for the bilinguality of my site, I need to do that anyway. The first plugin is used to display the month names in the right language. The last one creates blog pages filtered by category (German and English).

I’d prefer letting GitHub Pages do the compiling for me. I’m not really happy with my current solution. However I exchanged the plugin for the sitemap for now.

The _404.html_ gets a _YAML front matter_ so it'll be ignored for sitemap generation.

__404.html__

```
---
sitemap: false
---
```

Sadly you currently can’t exclude files and directories without using _front matter_.
