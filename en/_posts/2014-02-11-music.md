People tend to use services like Spotify more and more these days. Some of them even use it exclusively. I still use iTunes.

My media library is properly tagged. Every album has an album cover. Additionally I have a rather long _Various Artists_ playlist. Songs without a whole album, compilation, whatsoever get the album artist `Various Artists`. A smart playlist grabs all titles with this album artist.

Yes, I need to go through my podcasts. I know that.

iTunes manages my music directory automatically. When I open a mp3, it adds it to the library and copies it to the media directory.

While driving, Iâ€™m using an iPod touch. Sadly, my latch is about to die. Sometimes the sound is too quiet or with cracking noises.

How do you handle your music? Do you even _handle_ it? Streaming?
