In 2009, Laura Groves released her debut album _Blue Roses_ under the same name on XL Recordings. Laura is also lead-singing in the band Nautic from London. In February, her third EP _Committed Language_ came out; a four-piece collection of beautiful and touching pop-oriented songs full of warmth.

First introduced to me by Andrew Jerwis on the [98th installment](https://bandcamp.com/?show=114) of the Bandcamp Weekly, the record reposed in my wishlist for a few months. Now it’s in the bag.

The opener of the EP *Committed Language*  is a slow-starting, quiet song that develops a moody groove halfway through powered by a sharp voice. That melody in the background during the refrain could go on and on. “Into the light, into the light, intooo …”

Dream Story features a voice just as sharp and really puts me into a little daydream. The whole structure sways and swings. Timidly quiet starting segments which turn into slightly breezier pieces with subtle crescendos. Everything is covered in a woozy atmosphere. The simple background melodies and beats make things concrete.

The third song *Friday* has more of a ballad-like aesthetic with a piano accentuating the whole song. Although not everyone might agree, the song sounds like a perfectly fine Friday to me. “In my life. In my life. Need you in my life!”

*Mystique* is the last track on this EP and sticks out as a special distinctable piece at first glance. It soon evolves into a theme quite similar to that of *Dream Story*. Again layered sustained voices make the mood. All that is accompanied by romantic percussions of the slow drums. Beautiful. “I think I’m ready now, bring back the mistery.”

This is one of my latest favorites. The folk-influence nostalgic vibe of this kind of pop music is getting to me. Maybe we can expect an album from Laura – she talked a little bit about albums in general in the above-mentioned weekly show with Andrew Jerwis.
