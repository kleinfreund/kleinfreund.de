# kleinfreund.github.io

This is the repository for my personal site [kleinfreund.de](http://kleinfreund.de). I’m using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com). That way I don’t need to build the site by hand every time I want to push new stuff. GitHub Pages does that for me. Downside? Not being able to use plugins.

## To Do

### Under the hood

-

### Site enhancements

- New contact (?) page (story about the current state of how the site is made)

### Posts

-

### Performance

- Leverage browser caching
- Specify dimensions for `img` tags
- Minify HTML
- Minify CSS (Omit space in media queries)
- Inline critical CSS with `loadCSS();` (testing this currently)
- Async webfont loading
