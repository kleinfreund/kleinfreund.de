# kleinfreund.github.io

This is the source code of my personal website. It's the final project for our web design class. This gives me the opportunity to finally work on something I kept on cold storage.

## Tools

* __Sublime Text 2__ (coding)
* __Prepros__ (compile SCSS)
* __GitHub__ (hosting)
* __Bridge/Photoshop__ (image processing)
* __iTunes__ (music :)

## Things to talk about

We do have some restrictions including a kinda predefined directory structure and not embedding online sources. The website needs to be functional offline.

* moving html files to root
* moving `icon.png` to root
* using normalize.css
* using inuitcss
* no php-powered contact form

## To do

* create logo/favicon
* create `robots.txt`
* create `sitemap.xml`
* write documentation
* test (IE8, old browsers in school)
* write articles:
  * How the site was build
  * CSS style guide
* finish `profil.html`:
  * add photo
  * add further information
* try jekyll to generate the site
