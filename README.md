# kleinfreund.github.io

This is the source code of my personal website. It's the final project for our web design class. This gives me the opportunity to finally work on something I kept on cold storage.

## Tools

* __Sublime Text 2__ (coding)
* __Prepros__ (compile SCSS)
* __GitHub__ (hosting)
* __Bridge/Photoshop__ (image processing)
* __iTunes__ (music :)

## Things to talk about

We do have some restrictions including a kinda predefined directory structure and not embedding online sources. The website needs to be functional offline.

* using inuitcss

## To do

* write meta description
* write documentation
* write articles:
  * How the site was build
  * CSS style guide
* finish `profil.html`:
  * add photo
  * add further information
* try jekyll to generate the site
* test (IE8, old browsers in school)

## Done

* create `robots.txt`
* create `sitemap.xml`
* create logo/favicon
* add to Google Webmaster Tools
* Rename `page__frame--foot` to `page__foot` and select `.page__foot, .page__head` (?) ...probably not.
* Remove `kontakt.html` (backup!)
* Add `portfolio.html` instead
* Rename class `entry__header` to `entry__heading`
