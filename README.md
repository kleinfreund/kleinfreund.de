# kleinfreund.github.io

This is the repository for my personal site [kleinfreund.de](http://hey.kleinfreund.de). I’m using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com). That way I don’t need to build the site by hand every time I want to push new stuff. GitHub Pages does that for me. Downside? Not being able to use plugins.

## To Do

- Post about Transistor (?)
- Post about Moonman (?)
- Handling tags in posts, not only on the blog index
