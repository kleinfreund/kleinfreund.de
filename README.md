# kleinfreund.github.io

This is the repository for my personal site [kleinfreund.de](http://kleinfreund.de). I’m using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com). This means it’s build automatically whenever I push the repository to GitHub.

## To do

- What to do with the contact page (?)
  - A page that holds information which techniques/tools the site is currently using (?)
- Blog en show only list of posts > make it nice (?)
- Posts
  - `jekyll-sitemap` Plugin and GitHub Pages (publish date?)
  - Jekyll Front-Matter defaults (publish date?)
  - Revamping the site in general
  - Portfolio: Typo Alphabet
- CSS
  - Better formatting for inline code snippets
  - Small screen site-header stuff looks bad. Don’t like it.
- Under the hood
  - 3 layouts for 3 colors to leave out `page-class` in posts?
  - Use `lang:` instead of `categories:` for language stuff? (?)
