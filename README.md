# kleinfreund.github.io

This is the source code of my personal website. It's the final project for our Webdesign class.

## Tools I'm using

* Sublime Text 2 for coding
* Prepros to compile my SCSS files
* GitHub to publish the site
* Bridge and Photoshop for image processing

## Things to talk about

* 404.html needs to be in the root directory
* html-files in general should be in the root directory
* icon.png should be in root directory as well
* Is using normalize.css possible?
* Is using inuitcss possible?
* Is a php powered contact form really necessary?
