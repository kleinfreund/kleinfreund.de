# kleinfreund.github.io

This is the repository for my personal site [kleinfreund.de](http://kleinfreund.de). I’m using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com). This means it’s build automatically whenever I push the repository to GitHub.

## To do

- What to do with the contact page (?)
  - A page that holds information which techniques/tools the site is currently using (?)
- Blog en show only list of posts > make it nice (?)
- Posts
  - Revamping the site in general
- CSS
  - Make useful `:visited` links
  - Better formatting for inline code snippets
  - Rename SCSS variables according to site revamp
- Under the hood
  - Use `lang:` instead of `categories:` for language stuff? (?)
