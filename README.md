# kleinfreund.github.io

This is the source code of my personal website. It's the final project for our web design class. This gives me the opportunity to finally work on something I kept on cold storage.

## Tools

* __Sublime Text 2__ (coding)
* __Prepros__ (compile SCSS)
* __GitHub__ (hosting)
* __Bridge/Photoshop__ (image processing)
* __iTunes__ (music :)

## Things to talk about

We do have some restrictions including a kinda predefined directory structure and not embedding online sources. The website needs to be functional offline.

* using inuitcss

## To do

- Reconsider images in articles
- write meta description (for real this time)
- write documentation
- article: How the site was build
- article: CSS Styleguide
- profil: add photo
- profil: add further information
- test (IE8, old browsers in school)

## Done

- fix logo having both `src`-attribute AND `background-image`
- fix relative paths not beginning with `/`
- fix flexing `site-nav__item`s not having `display: block;` on mobile
- create `robots.txt`
- create `sitemap.xml`
- create logo/favicon
- add site to Google Webmaster Tools
- rename `page__frame--[head|foot]` to `page__[head|foot]`
- remove `kontakt.html`
- add `portfolio.html`
- Rename `entry__header` to `entry__heading`

## Future plans

- try jekyll to generate the site
