# kleinfreund.github.io

This is the repository for my personal site [kleinfreund.de](http://hey.kleinfreund.de). I’m using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com). That way I don’t need to build the site by hand every time I want to push new stuff. GitHub Pages does that for me. Downside? Not being able to use plugins.

The articles on my site are Open Source and can be freely used under the conditions of the CC BY-SA license (see [below](#licenses)). Same goes for the code used to build the site.

## Build Locally

To build the site locally (with Jekyll), you need to have Ruby and the Ruby gems `jekyll` and `jekyll-sitemap` installed.

Additionally, there are some things that might be required. For example, Jekyll currently needs a JavaScript runtime (i.e. Node.js). On Windows, the `wdm` gem is required to poll for file changes.

## To Do

- Do I really want to keep writing bilingually? It adds quite the barrier to writing at all
