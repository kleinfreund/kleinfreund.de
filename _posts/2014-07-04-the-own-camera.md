I have my own camera for a few months now. My first thought was in the direction of a cute mirrorless ([Sony NEX-3N](http://www.amazon.com/Sony-NEX-3NL-Compact-Interchangeable-Digital/dp/B00BF9MUBM)).

One makes a couple of compromises in this price segment. The cameras are small and light, but the handling is orientated as a consumer product for the masses. Touch screen, confusing menu navigation, partially poor processing.

My budget was somewhat small, but for 280 € all seemed pretty okay. Because the Amazon price was up by the time I wanted to place the order, I ordered from Conrad. Not a good idea.

After two weeks of not receiving a confirmation, I called them. They told me that they were out of stock and that they cancelled my order. Bad thing about that? They didn’t tell me.

Back to the beginning. That somewhat stole my thunder and my eyes were back on single-lens reflex cameras. Eventually I bought the [Canon EOS Rebel T3i](http://www.amazon.com/Canon-Digital-Imaging-18-55mm-3-5-5-6/dp/B004J3V90Y) from Media Markt including a bag, a cleaning cloth and a SD card for 400 gold coins—the camera alone costs around 550 € currently, so much for that.

The camera has a good screen—also counting the selfie feature (one can pull it out)—which I use as a viewfinder surprisingly frequent (Live View is not that bad).

Navigation is flexible just like we’re used to from DSLR’s. The kit lense does a good job, unless when used in low light. Understandable.

My next investigation will be <s>replacing my ailing mobile phone</s> the expecting [Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 II](http://www.amazon.com/Canon-50mm-1-8-Camera-Lens/dp/B00007E7JU)
